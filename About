    <h1>About Lyra Elenai</h1>
    <p>Lyra Elenai is a soft voice rising through the silence — a sacred author, intuitive scribe, and guide for those returning to themselves after long journeys through numbness, confusion, or emotional disconnection.</p>
    
    <p>Her debut book, <em>Coming Home to Yourself</em>, offers a threshold for gentle healing. Each page was written with the intention to be a first breath — not a fix, but a quiet hand reaching out in the dark.</p>
    
    <p>Drawn to soul language, embodied remembrance, and the alchemy of stillness, Lyra writes not to teach, but to hold — to offer sacred spaces where sensitivity is no longer something to overcome, but something to come alive within.</p>

    <p>Outside of writing, she tends to unseen altars: working with subtle energy, plant allies, and ancient memory. Her field speaks to those on the cusp — the quietly awakening, the quietly surviving, the quietly beginning again.</p>
